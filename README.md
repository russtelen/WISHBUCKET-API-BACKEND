# Installation Instructions

The app requires appsettings.json to follow the format provided in the `appsettingsTEMPLATE.json` file placed in the project folder. The app also requires a running SQL or Azure SQL instance that the app can be connected to. Before running the app the `WishContext` and `AuthContext` migrations have to be run in order to configure the required tables, and the default seed data.

The app requires the user secrets to follow the format provided in the `secretsTEMPLATE.json` file placed in the project folder.
In order for the authentication to function the `JWT_SITEKEY` has to be at least 16 characters long, and `JWT_ISSUER` has to be set to the url that the app is running on

## Replicating the migrations
The necessary migrations for AuthContext and WishContext are already included with the project. However, the following steps can replicate it 

```
Add-Migration -Context AuthContext
Add-Migration -Context WishContext
Update-Database -Context AuthContext
Update-Database -Context WishContext
```
